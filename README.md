# What is DSM
DSM delegates between package/download components, and container runtime managers. It further provides an "up-facing" interface upon which remote management may be built to control the lifecyle of containerized services.

This is an initial implementation. It utilizes TR-181's datamodel concept of Execution Environment, Deployment Unit and Execution Unit. By executing actions on those entities it translates behavior to providers using adapters:

1. Packager (tar (now), LIRA (future))
2. Runtime (Dobby/crun)

# Build
It assumes Linux based system. Currently tested on ubuntu/debian. DSM has an optional dependency on rbus and librbusprovider. This is currently off by default.

1. Git clone project
2. Enter main directory
3. `mkdir build; cd build`
4. `cmake .`.
    - if you want the rbus provider to be built add "-D ENABLE_RBUS_PROVIDER=ON" to the cmake command
5. make, and optionally make install (usually requires sudo)
6. go to <dsm>/build/bin, or /usr/local/bin (after install)
7. you can see 2 executables
    - dsm - this is main daemon with management logic
    - dsmcli - this is cli connecting to dsm over socket and executing commands

Although to build the project dependencies are not required. Dobby is required in runtime to manage the container. Note: A Vagrant VM provides all dependencies for developers.

# Important folders
1. repo - this is packet of test packages / deployment units
    - sample.tar and hello_world.tar are just simple packaged
    - busybox.tar is the package that has propper bundle definition created from standard busybox OCI image. It executes command `sleep infinity`. It is used for testing of start stop container
    - Packages may also be downloaded over HTTP by specifying http://<package> as the URL
    - With the default packager, packages must be of the form [package-name].tar and have the structure [package-name]/rootfs & [package-name]/config.json (These are OCI Bundles)
2. destination - this is the destination directory used for installation

# Use
export DSM_CONFIG_FILE=<full_path_of_dsm.config> e.g. /home/vagrant/dsm.config (This is set by default in Vagrant VM, see src/dsm.config for an example).  
If using vagrant VM you may need to first start RBUS with ` rtrouted -f -l DEBUG` before running `dsm`. If you need to restart rtrouted run `killall -9 rtrouted; rm -fr /tmp/rtroute*; rtrouted -f -l DEBUG`

1. Start dsm, % `dsm`
2. Give commands to dsm
    - % `dsmcli eu.list`
    - % `dsmcli du.list`
    - % `dsmcli du.install [target execution env] [package name/url]`
    - % `dsmcli du.list`
    - % `dsmcli du.detail [package name]`
    - % `dsmcli eu.list`
    - % `dsmcli eu.detail [uid]`
    - % `dsmcli eu.start [uid]`
    - % `dsmcli du.detail [uid]`
    - you can check also use DobbyTool list and DobbyTool info
    - % `dsmcli eu.stop [uid]`
    - % `dsmcli du.detail [uid]`
    
# Idea
DSM is a server with controller that manages status with concept of Execution Environments, Deployment Units and Execution Units. It uses Packager and Runtime to translate commands. Each technology e.g. TAR packager, Dobby/crun runtime are attached by adapters

# Repo Structure
1. src/ DSM source code
2. integration/ Materials (patch sets and scripts) for end-to-end integration in, for example, RDK-B 22q1 on RPI with TR-181 Data Model. Integration to RDK-B will ultimately be supported by modification to the relevant layers, and recipes.
3. develop/ Support for developers including Vagrant machine definition for end-to-end development from USP Data Model, to DSM, to Dobby
